/**
* Contact class definition.
*
* A Contact has the following fields within itself:
*
* - A contact_id, provided by the database, and useful when mapping this
*		object as a part of the ContactList (defined in ../components/).
* - The contact's first_name, a String with a length of up to 64 characters.
* - The contact's last_name, a String with a length of up to 64 characters.
* - The contact's phone, a String with a length of up to 25 characters.
* - The contact's imageFile, an Image file retrieved from the form.
* - The contact's img_url, a String telling where in Amazon S3 the provided
*		image is saved, so that the ContactList can just reference it (via src)
*		in the HTML.
* - The contact's thumbnail_url, a String telling where in Amazon S3 is a
*		resized version of the image saved, so that the ContactList can just
*		reference it (via src) in the HTML. It is actually the resized image that
*		gets displayed in this app.
*
* Notice how the imageFile is the only field in camelCase, indicating that
* it is NOT to be saved in the database, unlike all of the other fields, which
*	are in snake_case.
*
* This object also contains the function to upload the information into a
*	web service. The URL for that is in the configuration file (found in the
* ../config/config.js path).
